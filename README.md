Terraform module to provision Opsgenie resources using the Opsgenie provider. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
It consist of root module which is only here as an example but can be used as a combination of all submodules. Submodules can also be combined to abstract away complexity of setting up for example a team escalation.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!






## Introduction

Available modules:
- [Alert Policy](modules/alert_policy)
- [API Integration](modules/api_integration)
- [Config](modules/config)
- [Escalation](modules/escalation)
- [Notification Policy](modules/notification_policy)
- [Team](modules/team)
- [Team Routing Rule](modules/team_routing_rule)
- [User](modules/user)
- [Service](modules/service)
- [Service Incident Rule](modules/service_incident_rule)

**Note:** Root module is just an example that uses all of submodules.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


Here's how to invoke `team` module in your projects

```hcl
module "team-name" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management.git//modules/team?ref=master"

  team = {
    name        = "team-name"
    description = "team-description"
  }
}
```




## Examples

Here are examples of using the module:

- [`complete`](examples/complete) - complete example of using this module

Submodules examples:
- [`alert_policy`](examples/alert_policy)
- [`api_integration`](examples/api_integration)
- [`escalation`](examples/escalation)
- [`notification_policy`](examples/notification_policy)
- [`team`](examples/team)
- [`team_routing_rule`](examples/team_routing_rule)
- [`user`](examples/user)

Here is an example of using the `config` module, which incorporates all resource declarations into a single module:
- [`config`](examples/config)

Here are automated tests for the examples using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and provisions the examples):
 - [test](test)
