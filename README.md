Terraform module to provision Opsgenie resources using the Opsgenie provider. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
It consist of root module which is only here as an example but can be used as a combination of all submodules. Submodules can also be combined to abstract away complexity of setting up for example a team escalation.

[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!






## Introduction

Available modules:
- [Alert Policy](modules/alert_policy)
- [API Integration](modules/api_integration)
- [Config](modules/config)
- [Escalation](modules/escalation)
- [Notification Policy](modules/notification_policy)
- [Team](modules/team)
- [Team Routing Rule](modules/team_routing_rule)

**Note:** Root module is just an example that uses all of submodules.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/releases).


Here's how to invoke `team` module in your projects

```hcl
module "team-name" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management.git//modules/team?ref=master"

  team = {
    name        = "team-name"
    description = "team-description"
  }

}
```




## Examples

Here is an example of using all submodules:
- [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/complete) - complete example of using this module

Submodules examples:
- [`alert_policy`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/alert_policy)
- [`api_integration`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/api_integration)
- [`escalation`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/escalation)
- [`notification_policy`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/notification_policy)
- [`team`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/team)
- [`team_routing_rule`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/team_routing_rule)

Here is an example of using the `config` module, which incorporates all resource declarations into a single module:
- [`examples/config`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/config)
