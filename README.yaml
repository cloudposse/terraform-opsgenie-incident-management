# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision Opsgenie resources using the Opsgenie provider. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.
  It consist of root module which is only here as an example but can be used as a combination of all submodules. Submodules can also be combined to abstract away complexity of setting up for example a team escalation.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  Available modules:
  - [Alert Policy](modules/alert_policy)
  - [API Integration](modules/api_integration)
  - [Config](modules/config)
  - [Escalation](modules/escalation)
  - [Notification Policy](modules/notification_policy)
  - [Team](modules/team)
  - [Team Routing Rule](modules/team_routing_rule)

  **Note:** Root module is just an example that uses all of submodules.

usage: |-
  Here's how to invoke `team` module in your projects

  ```hcl
  module "team-name" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management.git//modules/team?ref=master"

    opsgenie_provider_api_key = var.opsgenie_provider_api_key

    team = {
      name        = "team-name"
      description = "team-description"
    }

  }
  ```

# Example usage
examples: |-
  Here is an example of using all submodules:
  - [`examples/complete`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/complete) - complete example of using this module

  Submodules examples:
  - [`alert_policy`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/alert_policy)
  - [`api_integration`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/api_integration)
  - [`escalation`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/escalation)

  - [`team_routing_rule`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/examples/team_routing_rule)

  Here is an example of using the `config` module, which incorporates all resource declarations into a single module:
